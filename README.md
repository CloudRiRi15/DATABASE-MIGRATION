This is the documentation of a hands-on project I did on database migration using AWS Database Migration Service. 

## AWS Database Migration Service

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a web service you can use to migrate data from your database that is on-premises, on an Amazon Relational Database Service 
(Amazon RDS) DB instance, or in a database on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to a database on an AWS service. These services can include a 
database on Amazon RDS or a database on an Amazon EC2 instance. You can also migrate a database from an AWS service to an on-premises database. You can migrate between 
source and target endpoints that use the same database engine, such as from an Oracle database to an Oracle database. You can also migrate between source and target 
endpoints that use different database engines, such as from an Oracle database to a PostgreSQL database. A detailed Documentation on the AWS Database Migration Service can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/index.html)
